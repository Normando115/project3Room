<h1> Artist Statement</h1>
<p> For this project, I wanted to make my room because it is something that I feel represents what kind of person someone is
The things that a person puts in their room shows their personality and what they feel is a necessity in their lives
In my room, I have very few things because I feel that I only need food, entertainment, something to work on, music and a bed.
This shows that I don't value having a lot in my room and would rather live minimalistically. </p>
